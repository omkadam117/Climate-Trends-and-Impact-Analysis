# Climate Change Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical temperature trends to assess the impact of climate change. The analysis includes data preprocessing, trend analysis, and visualization of annual average temperatures.

## Project Structure
- `data/temperature_data.csv`: Sample dataset containing historical temperature data.
- `analysis.py`: Python script for loading, preprocessing, and analyzing the temperature data.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


python analysis.py

### **5. Running the Project**

1. **Prepare the Data**: Place your `temperature_data.csv` in the `data/` directory.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run `python analysis.py` to process the data and generate the plot.
3. **Review Results**: Check the `temperature_trends.png` file for the plotted results.

This example provides a basic framework for a climate change impact analysis project. Depending on your requirements, you can expand it to include more sophisticated analyses, additional data sources, or advanced statistical methods.
